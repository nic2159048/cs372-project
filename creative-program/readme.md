Do you like music videos, but don't have the time to make them, then this is the program for you. mandelVis.go visualizes a wav file through its samples and creates a sequence of mandelbrots from them. The process is fairly simple, we read the different samples from the given file and convert that to a -x and -y coordinate options for mandelbrot.go. The samples combined with an incremental -r rotation value means we get slight movement across each jpg, but when converted to frames for a video becomes an animation backed by the given wav file. 

To use this program you need the go-wav library from https://github.com/youpy/go-wav, as well as ffmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org/. Go-wav allows us to read wav files while ffmpeg allows us to combine them into a video and merge that video with the wav file, and finally mandelbrot.go from https://github.com/marijnfs/gomandel which generates the mandelbrot image. The interesting part of this program is that while it does take a while to run, in other languages it would take even longer due to Go's speed.
