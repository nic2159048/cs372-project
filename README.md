# cs372-project
[](https://github.com/nic2159048/cs372-project)

A repo for all parts of our program 4 project in which we will explore the Go programming language.

We chose Go (a.k.a. Golang) because we were interested in a high-performance langauge which was a little more established than Rust.

To learn more about Go see our [language study!](language_study.md)

For an example of Go in action see our [Rot 13 Program](ROT13.go)

Additional information and downloads of Go's compiler are available at [golang.org](golang.org)

# Creative Program
We can add a description of the program we make in part 3 of the assignment here.
